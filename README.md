# Blockchain-Based-MFA
This system combines the robust security of MFA, the tamper-resistant nature of blockchain technology, and the automation capabilities of smart contracts to establish a highly secure and efficient authentication system for users.

The system in question is a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) solution that leverages blockchain technology as its underlying infrastructure. MFA, at its core, enhances security by requiring multiple forms of identification before granting access. This is akin to having multiple layers of protection, which significantly bolsters the system's security posture.

The utilization of blockchain in this context offers a highly secure and tamper-resistant ledger to store critical information and authentication records. Blockchain technology ensures the immutability and transparency of data, making it an ideal choice for storing sensitive authentication data.

Moreover, smart contracts are employed for user registration and authentication. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. In the context of user registration and authentication, smart contracts can be utilized to automate the verification and approval processes, thereby streamlining and enhancing the user experience while maintaining security protocols.

The HTML, css and js codes for the front end have also been uploaded.

The block.js code consists of a js code to integrate the smart contract with the front end.
